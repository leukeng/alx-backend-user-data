What is PII, non-PII, and personal data? [UPDATED]



Personally identifiable information (PII) and personal data are two classifications of data that often cause confusion for organizations that collect, store and analyze such data. 

PII is used in the US but no single legal document defines it. The legal system in the United States is a blend of numerous federal and state laws and sector-specific regulations. They all define and classify different pieces of information under the PII umbrella. 

On the other hand, personal data has one legal meaning, which is defined by the General Data Protection regulation (GDPR), accepted as law across the European Union (EU). 

Both terms cover common ground, classifying information that could reveal an individual’s identity directly or indirectly. 

But why is all that so important? As a website admin, app creator or product owner, you need to be aware that the traces visitors and users leave behind could be of a sensitive nature. These traces might enable you to identify individuals, so you need to handle such data with the utmost caution. From a legal standpoint, it could be a matter of breaches and violations with serious consequences. Grasping the bigger picture is crucial for your organization’s security and legal compliance.

What is personally identifiable information (PII)?
PII is often referenced by US government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Yet the US lacks one overriding law about PII, so your understanding of PII may differ depending on your particular situation.  

The most common definition is provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

It says that:

PII is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

However, the line between PII and other kinds of information is blurry. As stressed by the US General Services Administration, the “definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified”. 

What pieces of information are considered PII?
According to NIST, PII can be divided into two categories: linked and linkable information.

Linked information is more direct. It could include any personal detail that can be used to identify an individual. Examples of this kind of PII include:

Full name
Home address
Email address
Social security number
Passport number
Driver’s license number
Credit card numbers
Date of birth
Telephone number
Owned properties e.g. vehicle identification number (VIN) 
Login details
Processor or device serial number* 
Media access control (MAC)*
Internet Protocol (IP) address*
Device IDs*
